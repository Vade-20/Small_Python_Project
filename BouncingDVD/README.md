# Bouncing DVD Animation

This is a Python script that creates a simple DVD screensaver animation using the Tkinter library. The animation consists of a bouncing DVD logo that changes color each time it hits the edges of the canvas.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library

## Customization

You can customize the animation by modifying the code. Here are some possible modifications:

- **Colors**: The `colours` list contains the colors used for the DVD logo. You can add or remove colors to customize the animation.
- **Animation Speed**: The `root.after(10, moves)` line determines the speed of the animation. The number `10` represents the delay in milliseconds between each animation frame. You can increase or decrease this value to speed up or slow down the animation.
