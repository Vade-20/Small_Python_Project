# Caesar cipher

This repository contains a Python script that can be used to encrypt or decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabet. The encrypted or decrypted message is then automatically copied to the clipboard.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pyperclip` library (install using `pip install pyperclip`)

## Example
