# Cho-Han Game

This is a Python implementation of Cho-Han, a traditional Japanese dice game. In this game, two dice are rolled in a bamboo cup by the dealer sitting on the floor. The player's objective is to correctly guess if the sum of the dice will result in an even (cho) or odd (han) number.

## How to Play

1. At the beginning of the game, you will start with a total of 5000 mon (Japanese currency).
2. The game will prompt you to place a bet on whether the sum of the rolled dice will be even or odd. You can also choose to quit the game at any time.
3. Enter your bet amount in mon (an integer value). Make sure the bet amount is within the range of 1 to your total available money.
4. The dealer will then roll two dice and reveal the result to you.
5. If your guess (even or odd) matches the result of the dice roll, you win the bet, and the pot amount is added to your total money. The house will also collect a 10% fee from your winnings.
6. If your guess is incorrect, you lose the bet, and the bet amount is subtracted from your total money.
