# Collatz Sequence Generator

This is a simple program that generates the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer.


## Usage

1. Run the program using a Python interpreter.
2. You will be prompted to enter a positive integer.
3. If a non-positive integer or invalid input is provided, the program will continue to prompt for a valid input.
4. Once a valid input is provided, the program will generate the Collatz sequence for that number.
5. The Collatz sequence is generated by repeatedly applying the following rules:
    - If the current number is even, divide it by 2.
    - If the current number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
    - Repeat the above steps until the number becomes 1.
6. The program will output each step of the sequence in the format `number1, number2, ...`.
7. After reaching 1, you will be asked if you want to continue.
8. If you choose to continue (by entering 'Y' or 'y'), the program will prompt for a new positive integer.
9. If you choose not to continue (by entering any other input), the program will exit with a "Thank You" message.

Note: The program includes a `sleep` function with a delay of 0.1 seconds between each step of the sequence to provide visual clarity. You can modify this value to adjust the delay as per your preference.
