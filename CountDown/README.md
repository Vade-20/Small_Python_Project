# Number Countdown with Curses

This Python script performs a number countdown with custom patterns using the curses library. The countdown is displayed in a terminal-like environment, and a sound is played when the countdown reaches zero.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- curses (included in Python standard library)
- winsound (for Windows users)

## Installation

1. Clone or download the `numbers_.py` file and save it in the same directory as your main script.

## Usage

To run the number countdown program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Include the required libraries and functions at the beginning of your main script:

```python
from numbers_ import number_patterns
import curses
from curses import wrapper
from time import sleep
from datetime import datetime
import winsound
```

3. Set the parameter in `correct_time()` function to set the countdown time:

```python
def correct_time():
  # Set the time according to your needs here
  # -------------------------------------------
  hours = 0
  minutes = 0
  seconds = 300
  # --------------------------------------------
  # ... (validation and time adjustments)
  # ... (return the time object)
  return time_in_correct_form
```

5. Run your main script, and the countdown will start displaying numbers in the terminal-like window.

**Note:** This script relies on the curses library for terminal-like display, which may not work as expected in some IDEs or non-terminal environments. Additionally, the `winsound` module is used to play a sound, specifically for Windows users. For other platforms, an alternative method to play sounds may be required.
