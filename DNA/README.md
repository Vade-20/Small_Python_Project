# DNA 

This simple Python script generates an animated representation of a DNA strand using ASCII art. The script randomly selects pairs of nucleotides (A, T, C, G) and displays them in the DNA structure. The animation cycles through different stages of the DNA strand, creating a visually appealing effect.

## How to Run

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can run the script using the following command:

```bash
python dna_animation.py
```

## Configuration

You can customize the animation by adjusting the following parameters:

- `PAUSE`: Adjust the time delay between frames in seconds.

- `DNA`: Modify the ASCII art representation of the DNA strand. Each element in the list represents a frame of the animation, and `{}` is a placeholder for nucleotide pairs.


## Note
You can stop the animation at any time by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
