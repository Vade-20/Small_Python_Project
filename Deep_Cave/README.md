# Deep Cave 

This Python script creates a cave visualization that consists of a narrow passage represented by ASCII characters. The cave passage is displayed on the screen, and after the user presses Ctrl+C, a monster ASCII art will be shown.

## Customization

Although this script is primarily for visualization purposes, you can still customize it in the following ways:

- **Cave Width**: You can modify the `LEFT_WIDTH`, `GAP`, and `WIDTH` variables at the beginning of the script to adjust the size of the cave passage.

- **Pause Duration**: If you want to adjust the speed of the cave shifts, you can change the `PAUSE` variable, which represents the time in seconds between each visualization update.
