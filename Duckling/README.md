# Duckling ASCII Art Generator

This Python program creates ASCII art of ducklings that parade across your terminal. It's a fun and simple example of using Python's random module and terminal manipulation to display  ducklings.

## Program Details

- Ducklings are randomly generated with different appearances, including various eye styles, wing positions, and mouth shapes.

- Ducklings may face left or right, and their bodies and legs are generated accordingly.

- The program continues running until you interrupt it with a keyboard shortcut  `Ctrl + C`.

## Customization

- `DUCK_DENSITY`: Adjusts the frequency of duckling appearances. Higher values mean more ducklings.
