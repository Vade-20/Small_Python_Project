# Fish Tank Simulation
This Python script utilizes the curses library to create an animated fish tank simulation. The simulation features swimming fish, rising bubbles, and swaying seaweed in a terminal-based graphical environment.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- curses library (window-curses for window users)

## Features

- Various types of fish, each with unique appearances and behaviors.
- Seaweed that sways back and forth.
- Bubbles that rise to the water's surface.
- Visual representation of the tank's "ground."

## Controls

- The simulation runs automatically once you execute the script.
- Press `Ctrl+C` to exit the simulation and return to the command line.

## Customization

You can customize the simulation by adjusting the parameters in the script:

- `num_of_bubles`: Number of bubbles in the tank.
- `num_of_seaweeds`: Number of swaying seaweed.
- `num_of_fishes`: Number of swimming fish.
- `FISH_TYPES`: List of different fish types with their appearances.
