# Factor Finder 

## Description
The Factor Finder program is a Python script designed to calculate the factors of a given positive whole number and determine whether it is a prime or composite number. It's a simple educational tool that demonstrates the concept of factors, prime numbers, and composite numbers.

## Sample Output
Here's an example of what the program's output might look like:

Factor Finder, by Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com

A number's factors are two numbers that, when multiplied with each other, produce the number. For example, 2 x 13 = 26, so 2 and 13 are factors of 26. 1 x 26 = 26, so 1 and 26 are also factors of 26. We say that 26 has four factors: 1, 2, 13, and 26.

If a number only has two factors (1 and itself), we call that a prime number. Otherwise, we call it a composite number.

Can you discover some prime numbers?

Enter a positive whole number to factor or (Q)UIT : 26
The Factors are: 1,2,13,26

Enter a positive whole number to factor or (Q)UIT : 7
The Factors are: 1,7

Enter a positive whole number to factor or (Q)UIT : q
