# Wild West Fast Draw Game

Test your reflexes and see if you are the fastest draw in the west with this Python console-based game! When you see "DRAW", you have 0.3 seconds to press Enter. But be careful, if you press Enter before "DRAW" appears, you'll lose the game.

## How to Play

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. The game will display instructions and wait for you to press Enter to begin.
3. When prompted, press Enter to start a new round.
4. The script will randomly generate a time interval (between 2 and 7 seconds) before displaying "Draw".
5. After "Draw" appears, you have 0.3 seconds to press Enter.
6. If you press Enter within the time limit, the script will display your reaction time, and if you're fast enough, you win the round.
7. If you press Enter too early or too late (after the time limit), the script will inform you that you were too slow.
8. After each round, the game will ask if you want to continue playing or quit. Enter "Q" or "QUIT" to stop playing or press Enter to play another round.
