# Number Guessing Game README

This Python program is a simple number guessing game that allows the player to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides the player with 10 attempts to guess the correct number. After each guess, the game gives feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. If the player guesses the correct number within the given attempts, they win the game. Otherwise, the game reveals the correct number.
