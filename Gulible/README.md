## Gullible Person Busy Program

This is a joke Python program that interacts with the user, asking if they want to know how to keep a gullible person busy for hours. The program will keep asking for user input until they enter 'Y' for yes or 'N' for no.

### How to Use

1. Save the code into a Python file (e.g., `gullible_program.py`).

2. Run the script:

   ```
   $ python gullible_program.py
   ```

3. The program will repeatedly prompt the user with the question and handle their response.

4. If the user enters 'Y' (yes), the program will continue asking the question again.

5. If the user enters 'N' (no), the program will exit, printing "Thank you. Have a nice day!".

### Example

```
Do you want to know how to keep a gullible person busy for hours? Y/N
> y
Do you want to know how to keep a gullible person busy for hours? Y/N
> Y
Do you want to know how to keep a gullible person busy for hours? Y/N
> n
Thank you. Have a nice day!
```
