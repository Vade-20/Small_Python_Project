# Multiplication Table Grid

This Python script generates a multiplication table grid within a specified range of numbers. The grid displays the product of each combination of two numbers within the specified range.

## Usage

- The script sets a lower and higher limit for the range of numbers to be used in the multiplication table.

- The grid consists of rows and columns, where the top row represents the numbers within the specified range and the leftmost column represents the same numbers.

- The cell at the intersection of each row and column displays the product of the corresponding two numbers.

- The grid is visually separated using lines of `+` and `-` characters for clarity.

## Customization

- You can customize the `lower_limit` and `higher_limit` variables to change the range of numbers used in the multiplication table.

- If you wish to adjust the formatting, you can modify the `rjust()` and print functions accordingly.
