# Ninety Nine Bottles

## Introduction
This Python script uses the curses library to create an animated countdown of milk bottles on the wall. It simulates the classic "99 Bottles of Milk on the Wall" song, where bottles gradually disappear as the countdown progresses. The animation is displayed in the terminal.

## Requirements
Before running the script, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, make sure you have the `curses` library, which is commonly available in Python's standard library.

## Customization
You can customize the animation by adjusting the following variables:
- `PAUSE`: Controls the pause time between each step of the animation.
- The appearance of the milk bottle in the `BOTTLE` variable.
- Text messages and their timing in the animation loop.
