# Small Python Project

Al Sweigart `Big Book of Small Python Projects` has proven to be an invaluable resource for my Python learning journey. The project ideas put forth in the book have provided me with practical challenges to apply my newfound knowledge.

 As I tackle these projects, I take the code snippets provided by Switarch and modify them to match my understanding and learning progress. 

 Although the projects in this compilation draw inspiration from Sweigart's work, the code presented here reflects my own unique approach. Through these projects, I aim to honor Sweigart's contributions while providing learners with an opportunity to explore alternative solutions and enhance their programming skills.
