# Rainbow 

This Python script displays a colorful and animated RAINBOW text in your terminal using ANSI escape codes for different colors. The rainbow text will scroll across the terminal screen continuously. The animation can be stopped by pressing `CTRL+C`.

## How It Works

The script uses ANSI escape codes to change the color of the text in the terminal. It defines color codes for different colors and applies these codes to the text characters to create the rainbow effect. The animation is achieved by repeatedly printing the "RAINBOW" text with increasing and decreasing leading spaces.

The animation will continue until you manually interrupt it by pressing `CTRL+C`.

## Color Codes

The following color codes are used in the script:

- 1: Red
- 2: Orange
- 3: Yellow
- 4: Green
- 5: Blue
- 6: Indigo
- 7: Violet
