# ROT13 Cipher

## Introduction

The ROT13 Cipher is a simple text encryption/decryption tool that uses the ROT13 algorithm to transform input text. This program is designed to be easy to use and can be helpful for simple text obfuscation.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the ROT13 Cipher program:

```
$ python rot13cipher.py
ROT13 Cipher
Enter a message to encrypt/decrypt (or QUIT) : Hello, World!
The translated message is: Uryyb, Jbeyq!
(Copied to clipboard.)
---------------------------------------------
Enter a message to encrypt/decrypt (or QUIT) : QUIT
Thank you
```

## Notes

- This program only applies the ROT13 transformation to alphabetic characters and leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
